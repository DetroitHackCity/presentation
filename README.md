# Happy Hackathon Presentation

## Concept

Hackathons and health don't often go hand in hand - cranking out code and exercise are usually mutually exclusive - but **Happy Hackathon by Detroit Hack City** gamifies hackathon fitness and allows participants to compare their activity to others, as well as compete for the most steps logged during the event! :walking: :trophy:
